# UDP-RSA Image Sending

POC for sending image over UDP as chunks encrypted using the RSA encryption algorithm.

## How To Run:

- After cloning/downloading the repository, run 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `sender.py`
- While `sender.py` is running, run `receiver.py` as well
- An image should pop up after a few seconds. This means that the code worked :)
